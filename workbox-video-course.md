## Course details

### Title

Making offline-ready progressive web applications using Workbox

### Intro

The web platform is versatile, capable, and can go far beyond the browser tab while keeping its open and universal nature. We call “progressive” the web apps built using the latest browser APIs to achieve a new level of user experience. In this course, we'll convert a “classic” web application to progressive using Workbox - the latest version of the service worker automation library. So you can apply this knowledge for making any app progressive: offline-ready, network-optimized, installable, and ready for adopting new features from the PWA family.

### Description

During this practical, task-based training, you will learn about:

- Progressive Web App concept pillars
- Service Worker API fundamentals
- Current PWA support by different platforms (and workarounds when needed)
- Workbox library - an industry-standard in the automation of network-related PWA tasks

On the practical side, you will gain skills to build an app which is:

- Installable on all modern desktop and mobile operating systems
- Offline-ready: the app itself, smart caching strategies for the data it consumes, and network-resilient data sending
- Ready for being extended by the next PWA features coming to the web
- Following the modern web development flows for building a service worker

Also, I share lots of practical tips & tricks, both technical and UX, review real-life PWA examples, explain how to avoid common pitfalls, and how to deal with edge cases.

### Audience

For web frontend developers of all levels. Pre-requisites:

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript is required
- The knowledge of any framework(s) is not required
